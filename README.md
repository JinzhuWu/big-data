# big-data
Four projects in big data management

1. (In Mapreduce) Given a directed graph, compute the average length of the in-coming edges for each node. 
2. (In Mapreduce) Given a graph and a node “t”, find the shortest distances of all nodes to “t” together with the paths.
3. (In scala) Given a directed graph, compute the average length of the out-going edges for each node, and sort the nodes according to the average lengths in ascending order.
4. (In scala) Set Similarity Join Problem.
